The other trade-off is with the temporal resolution. MODIS has a higher temporal resolution with near daily coverage of the Earth. The Sentinel satellites have a 5 day revisit time and the Landsat satellite has a 16 day revisit period. Combined together in the HLS project, this equates to global coverage in 2 to 3 days.
