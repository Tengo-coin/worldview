For satellite instruments to obtain higher resolution imagery, there are trade-offs to consider. One is the amount of data that can be collected during the satellite overpass. The swath width of MODIS is 2330 km wide, which you can see here over Australia between the two black swath gaps. Sentinel 2A and 2B are 290 km which are the two lighter swaths on top on the MODIS image, and Landsat (not shown) is 180 km.
