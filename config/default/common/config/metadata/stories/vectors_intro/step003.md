Now we've added the Dams vector layer over the Reservoirs layer on the map. The Dams layer provides dam location next to their associated reservoirs. The layer displays the primary uses of these dams in the left side Layer List: Not Classified (white), Fisheries (light green), Flood Control (maroon), Hydroelectricity (yellow), Irrigation (brown), Navigation (orange), Other (pink), Recreation (purple), and Water Supply (green). Hover over the colors in the Layer List or over the colored points on the map to find out the dam's primary use.
